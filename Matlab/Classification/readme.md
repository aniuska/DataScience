# Binary Classification

## The problem

* Predicting student performance (i.e. passing/failing) based on information about students.
* Previous studies (Kotsiantis et al. 2004) show that student achievement is highly affected by previous performances.
* Although such scores were available we decided to exclude them to try and investigate other predictors (demographic, 
social/emotional and school related).

## Analysis of Dataset
* Student data from 2005-2008 for 2 public secondary schools from Alentejo region of Portugal derived from schools reports and 
questionnaires.
* Two datasets were used: Portuguese language (549 observations) and Maths (339 observations). They were analysed independently.
* 29 out of 36 discrete features used (16 categorical and 13 numeric). The labels were converted from discrete scale 0-20 to a 
binary Pass/Fail scale.
* A basic statistical summary and histogram plots created to determine probabilistic distribution of data.
* Zero p value indicates dependence amongst features.

## Hypothesis
* How well can student performance be predicted using demographic, social/emotional and school related features?
* What are the factors that affect student performance?
